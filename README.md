# Airbnb-clone-project


This project is a simplified clone of Airbnb that allows users to browse, list, and book rental properties.


# Team Roles
- Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
- Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
- DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
- QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

# Technology Stack
- Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
- GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- Redis: Used for caching and session management.
- Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

# Database Design
- Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
- Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

# Feature Breakdown
- User Authentication
-  Property Management
- Payment Processing

# API Security
## Authentication
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system trying to access the API. It answers the question: Who are you?

Common methods include:
- API keys: A unique token provided to each user.
- OAuth tokens: Access tokens issued after a user authorizes your app.
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Self-contained tokens that include user identity and claims.
- Basic Authentication: Username and password encoded in headers.

The client must prove who they are before accessing protected resources.

## Authorization
Authorization happens after authentication and determines what an authenticated user or system is allowed to do.

It answers the question: What are you allowed to access or perform?

Examples:
- User A can read data but cannot delete it.
- Admin users can access all endpoints.
- This can be role-based (RBAC), attribute-based (ABAC), or permission-based.
- Enforced by checking permissions/roles against requested actions.

## Rate Limiting
Rate limiting controls how many requests a client or user can make to the API within a given time frame.
Purpose:
- Prevent abuse or overload on the API servers.
- Mitigate denial of service (DoS) attacks.
- Ensure fair usage among users.
Example:
- Allow 1000 requests per hour per user/IP.
- When limits are exceeded, the API responds with an error (e.g., HTTP 429 Too Many Requests).
- Implemented using tokens, counters, or sliding windows.

# CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions
- Docker
- We use GitHub Actions and Docker to automate our CI/CD pipeline.  
## This ensures faster and more reliable deployments by:
- Running automated tests on every commit
- Building Docker containers for consistent environments
- Deploying new code with minimal manual intervention
